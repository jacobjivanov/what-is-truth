OT: Genesis 1-2
- Our God is the Creator of the universe
- Physical creation is good (contra-Gnosticism)
- Regardless of the timespan and exact process of creation, this universe is not cold, mechanical, probabilistic, and purposeless.
- God sovereignly controls and upholds all things.
NT: 2 Timothy 3:14-17
- All Scripture is God-breathed
- All Scripture is useful and equips us
