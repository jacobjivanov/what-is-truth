### JAN 01
OT: Genesis 1-2
- Our God is the Creator of the universe
- Physical creation is good (contra-Gnosticism)
- Regardless of the timespan and exact process of creation, this universe is not cold, mechanical, probabilistic, and purposeless.
- God sovereignly controls and upholds all things.

NT: 2 Timothy 3:14-17
- All Scripture is God-breathed
- All Scripture is useful and equips us

### JAN 02
OT: Genesis 3-4
- Satan deceived Eve into sin, and Adam willingly rebelled against God’s command
- Paradise wasn't enough for humanity, they wanted to be like God
- The brokenness of the world is due to mankind’s sin
- Yet God promised that one day, a human would crush the serpent, yet would be struck in the process
- This is the proto-Evangelion, the first promise of a savior
- With Cain murdering Abel and Lamech arrogant about his own violence, humanity spirals downward

NT: Matthew 1
- Jesus Christ’s genealogy (with a few skips) back to Abraham is listed.
- God’s plan cannot be thwarted. 2000 years of slavery, war, corruption, and sin could not stop Christ’s incarnation.
- God uses broken people and events to accomplish His ultimate plan.
- Christ’s birth to a virgin, Mary, is a miracle from the Holy Spirit

### JAN 03
OT: Genesis 5-6
- Matt Whitman from TMBH made the point that early Genesis show a lot of 'test cases' for a perfect society.
- For example, a paradise (Garden of Eden) with only one rule? Does not work, humanity rebelled against God.
- A world with no law (pre-Flood)? No good. Humanity immediately descends into chaos.
- Tomorrow we will see if only keeping the good people works...
NT: Matthew 2
- Christ was seen as a threat to the political and religious establishment, but as incoming savior by those 'far off' (the Wise Men)
- King Herod was more than willing to slaughter innocent children. He also killed his own sons and wife, so this was nothing surprising.
